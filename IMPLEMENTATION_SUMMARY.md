## Additions for Access, Organizations, Assignments, and NOC/Topology

- New migration `0009_orgs_contracts_assignments_topology` adds:
  - `organizations`, `contracts`, `contract_wards`, `assignments`
  - Extends `incidents` with `assigned_org_id`, `severity_sla_minutes`, `due_at`
  - Topology: `splitters`, `splitter_ports`, `olt_ports`, `cable_register`
- New models imported in `app/models/__init__.py`.
- New routers and endpoints:
  - `POST /contracts`, `POST /assignments`
  - `GET /work-queue` (uses `X-Org-Id`, `X-Role`)
  - `PATCH /incidents/assign` (body includes `incident_id`)
  - `POST /tests/otdr/import` (snap OTDR event distance to cable map)
- Webhooks tightened: HMAC via `NMS_HMAC_SECRET`, IP allow list via `WEBHOOK_IP_ALLOW_LIST`, 30-minute dedup, clear handlers, auto-assign with SLA due.
- Scheduler: simple paging log for imminent P1 SLA breaches.

Setup notes: run Postgres via `infra/docker-compose.yml`, set `DATABASE_URL`, run Alembic migrations, then `uvicorn app.main:app`.
