Add organizations, contracts, assignments, work queue, and auto-routing

Key changes:

- Alembic 0009: Added `organizations`, `contracts`, `assignments`; new fields on `tasks` and `incidents`; indexes and FKs.
- Models: Updated `Incident`, `Task`, `PON` with fields for org assignment and ward/pon_number.
- Service: New `app/services/routing.py` for assignment lookup and SLA calculation; used by webhooks and tasks.
- Routers: New `contracts`, `assignments`, `work_queue`, `incidents_assign` endpoints.
- Webhook: LibreNMS handler now routes incidents with SLA due time.
- Tasks: Update handler auto-assigns contractor org based on step and PON.
- Main: Registered new routers.
- Seed: Added `db/init/020_seed_orgs_contracts_assignments.sql` with sample orgs, contract, and assignments.

Smoke checks (examples):

```bash
# create contract
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/contracts -H "X-Role: ADMIN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"org_id":"<ORG-UUID>","scope":"Maintenance","wards":["48","49"],"sla_minutes_p1":120,"sla_minutes_p2":240,"sla_minutes_p3":1440,"sla_minutes_p4":4320}'

# create assignment
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/assignments -H "X-Role: ADMIN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"org_id":"<CIVIL-ORG-UUID>","scope":"Civil","ward":"48","priority":10}'

# my work queue (requires X-Org-Id header)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/work-queue -H "X-Org-Id: <ORG-UUID>"
```
